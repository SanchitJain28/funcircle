feat: Optimize images and navigation with Next.js components

Refactors the e-commerce home page to leverage Next.js's built-in `Image` and `Link` components, improving performance and SEO.

Key changes:
- Replaced standard `<img>` tags with the `next/image` component for automatic image optimization.
- Updated product links to use `next/link` for faster, client-side navigation.
- Converted the main page and the e-commerce `Home` component to Server Components by removing the `"useclient"` directive.
- Added new image provider domains to `next.config.ts`.
