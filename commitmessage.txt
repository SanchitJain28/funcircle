feat: Implement recent members feature and social media links

This commit introduces the following changes:

- **Database Schema:**
  - Modified `database_schema.sql` to order recent members by `created_at` in
      descending order within the `get_recent_members_for_user` function.

- **Badminton Page:**
  - Added Instagram and WhatsApp social media links to `src/app/(app)/badminton/page
      .tsx`.
  - Updated the canonical URL for the badminton page.
   
- **API Endpoint:**
     - Modified `src/app/api/fetch-recent-members/route.ts` to reverse the fetched
      recent members data and wrap it in a `data` object for the API response.
   
- **Auth Hook:**
     - Updated `src/hooks/useAuth.ts` to correctly handle the API response for fetching
      recent members.
