feat(seo): Add structured data and metadata for landing page

Adds comprehensive JSON-LD structured data to the main landing page (`src/app/page.tsx`) to improve SEO. This includes schemas for LocalBusiness, SportsActivityLocation, FAQPage, and an ItemList of sports venues by area in Gurgaon.

Also, removes redundant metadata from the badminton page (`src/app/(app)/badminton/page.tsx`) as this is now handled more centrally.
