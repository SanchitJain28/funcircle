fix(sitemap): use correct group id for group pages

The sitemap was generating incorrect URLs for group event pages. This was because the mapping was using 'id' from the generic 'TicketType' interface instead of the correct 'group_id'.

This change introduces a 'GroupType' interface and uses the correct 'group_id' property, ensuring that group page URLs in the sitemap are generated correctly.
