feat: dynamic sitemap generation

Refactored the sitemap generation to dynamically fetch ticket data from the /api/fetch-all-tickets endpoint. This ensures that the sitemap is always up-to-date with the latest live tickets.

- Modified src/app/sitemap.ts to include logic for fetching and mapping ticket data.
- Updated public/sitemap-0.xml with the newly generated sitemap.
