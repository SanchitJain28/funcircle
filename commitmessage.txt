feat(booking): Add 'Know Your Level' slider and update image domains

Introduces the `KnowYourLevel` component on the event ticket page, providing users with an interactive slider to better understand their skill level before booking.

- Adds `@radix-ui/react-slider` as a dependency and creates a new `Slider` component in the UI library.
- Integrates the `KnowYourLevel` component into the event ticket client.
- Updates `next.config.ts` to whitelist new image provider domains.
- Temporarily sets the default active venue to the second in the list for testing purposes.
