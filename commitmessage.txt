   feat(checkout): improve order creation validation and webhook handling
   
   Adds checks for the ticket ID and user ID in the `useCreateOrder` hook to
prevent the creation of incomplete orders. This change includes
user-friendly error messages and a redirect for a smoother user experience.
   
   The webhook processing is also improved with more detailed logging and
clearer error messages for missing data. Additionally, an image on the
ecommerce homepage has been temporarily commented out.
