feat(checkout): Add pre-checkout ticket availability check

This commit introduces a pre-checkout availability check to prevent users from attempting to purchase tickets that are out of stock.

The following changes have been made:

-   **Ticket Availability Check**: Before proceeding to payment, the system now queries the `tickets` table to verify that the requested number of tickets is available.
-   **Error Handling**: If tickets are unavailable, the user is shown a toast notification and the payment process is halted.
-   **Razorpay Types**: Added comprehensive type definitions for Razorpay to improve type safety and developer experience.

This enhancement ensures a smoother user experience by preventing orders that cannot be fulfilled and providing clear, immediate feedback.
