                We match players by booking through two or three codes
                simultaneously. Players can set their skill levels, which
                include beginner, beginner plus, intermediate, intermediate
                plus, and professional. These levels can be adjusted by the user
                or the admin. If the admin sets a player to beginner plus, the
                player cannot change their level and will only be matched with
                other beginner plus players.

                We also utilize code switching for players. For example, if one
                code has intermediate players and another has intermediate plus
                players, we can switch players based on their performance. If a
                player is struggling at the intermediate plus level while
                another excels at the intermediate level, we can connect them to

              How do players connect with each other? We have two major features
              for this. One is the Duo feature, where if a player likes or has a
              partner in their badminton game, they can make a duo with him and
              they can play together. If they want to book a court, they can
              also book it together so that two spots get filled and another duo
              with the same level will book the remaining spots. Also, they can
              create a squad of their own. A squad has 6-8 players and only duos
              can make it. So they can make their own squads and connect with
              players. They have their own leaderboards, like which duo is doing
              great, which duo is top of the week, and which squad is top of the
              week. Just like gaming, it is a leaderboard thing.
